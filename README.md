# Identity & Event Framework
This repo demonstrates how to use `@thxnetwork/sdk` to derive or create Identities and register Events for them.

## Install
1. Rename .env.example to .env
2. Register API Keys in THX Dashboard for a `client_credentials` grant and provide the `clientId` and `clientSecret` in your .env
3. Install dependencies with
```
npm i
```

## Usage
Adjust and run the script.
```
node sdk.js
```
